            <img src="Images/Blank Image.png" alt="blank">
               <p>Hailey Collin is a junior UX/UI designer based in Minnesota. She attended the University Of Minnesota bootcamp for UX/UI design from March 2024-September 2024 and is excited to bust into the world of technological design.
                <br>
                <br>
                As someone who has always had a passion for creativity Hailey is inspired by this field of work and can’t wait to grow within it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before entering the field of UX/UI Design Hailey was a licensed cosmetologist specializing in chemical services and color theory. For the last nearly ten years Hailey has also been working in the hospitality industry and has worked her way into management. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This has all helped her with learning how to empathize with others needs and desires.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hailey has also spent nearly ten years working in a restaurant and has moved into management. Through this she has learned how to empathize with others. She watches over a large staff of over ninety employees and will manage over forty in one shift. This job has also taught her how important communication is and time management because it’s not just her time she's managing, it’s also everyone else's.</p>
